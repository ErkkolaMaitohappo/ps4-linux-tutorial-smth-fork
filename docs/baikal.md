# Baikal specific page
If you landed here, it means you have the unluckiest southbridges of them all: the despicable Baikal chip. Unfortunately there aren't many fixes for this chip, but you may be able to get a working installation.

#> [!TIP]
#> Remember that the newest stable kernel is 5.4. Newer kernels do not exist right now.

## Why is baikal still unsupported?
Because there are no developers willing to put so much effort into the chip.

Aeolia and Belize work almost flawlessly between each others because they are very similar, but Baikal is completely different and adds a lot of work to the entire scene. This means that you are still stuck with older kernels which don't support newer `libdrm` versions which in turn don't support newer `mesa-git` versions and so on. It's an endless cycle.

In reality there's not much to say, so if you have any issues, shoot a message on the Discords.
