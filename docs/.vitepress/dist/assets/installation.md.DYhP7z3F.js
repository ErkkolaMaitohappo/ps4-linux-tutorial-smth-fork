I know, you&#39;re crying your heart out because you wanted to use it, but trust me it&#39;s atrocious. To give you an explanation, it took me 30 MINUTES to update my CachyOS installation (1500MBs) and the system was so unresponsive that I could watch entire anime episodes in between clicks.</p><p>Using an external SATA-USB adapter with a Samsung 870 EVO 500GB, the time it took shrinked to less than 5 minutes.</p><p>Therefore, let&#39;s clear some misinformation here:</p><ul><li>The PS4&#39;s internal HDD is a repurposed laptop 5400RPM drive. Please, for the love of GOD, do NOT use this. Even the PS4&#39;s own menus lag because of how slow it is.</li><li>The PS4 internal drive uses UFS encryption so it slows down significantly.</li><li>You CAN clone your PS4 HDD into an SSD, if internal installation is a must for you</li><li>The PS4 doesn&#39;t support TRIM, so a possible internal SSD swap would be a lot slower in writing data (a cached SSD with a garbage collector would be a bit better though, so don&#39;t worry)</li><li>PS4 Fat and Slim are limited to SATA-II, which is 3Gbps in speed (roughly 375MB/s), which people online say it&#39;s not enough (it&#39;s enough for a PS4). On the other hand, the PS4 Pro runs at SATA-III, which is 6Gbps (up to 750MB/s), so that can saturate every SATA SSD on the market. <ul><li>External SSD, on my 500GB Samsung 870 EVO, is 350MB/s-ish. So you&#39;d get the same performance as an internal drive (theoretically)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Again, internal SSD swap hasn&#39;t been tested, so your mileage may vary if you wanna go that route. If you have info on that, let me know.</p></details><h2 id="anyways-here-we-go-queue-dream-s-speedrunning-music" tabindex="-1">Anyways, here we go: (queue dream&#39;s speedrunning music) <a class="header-anchor" href="#anyways-here-we-go-queue-dream-s-speedrunning-music" aria-label="Permalink to “Anyways, here we go: (queue dream&#39;s speedrunning music)”">​</a></h2><ol><li>Boot your PS4 and launch GoldHen.</li><li>Take the initramfs.zip file, open it, and choose your installation method (mind the Southbridge) <ul><li>Put it somewhere like on your desktop as we&#39;ll need it</li></ul></li><li>Choose your kernel of choice</li><li>Choose your distro and and rename it <code>psxitarch.tar.xz/gz</code> depending on the original file type</li></ol><h2 id="choosing-a-method-of-installation" tabindex="-1">Choosing a method of installation <a class="header-anchor" href="#choosing-a-method-of-installation" aria-label="Permalink to “Choosing a method of installation”">​</a></h2><div class="warning custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>Choose ONLY ONE method of installation.</p><p>Installing on both the internal and external drives can cause problems!
