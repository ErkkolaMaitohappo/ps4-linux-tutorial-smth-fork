In layman&#39;s terms, think of it as the core of the OS. Installing Linux refers to installing a Linux distribution to use on your PS4 so that you can turn it into something like a desktop computer.</p></details><details class="details custom-block"><summary>Is it reversible? Will it delete all my games and saves?</summary><p>All your data will stay intact. Whether you install it on the internal HDD or an external drive, you will keep your data as you first need to exploit your console at every boot.</p><p>The internal drive method actually creates a file as big as you want it to be which is going to be mounted whenever you launch Linux as it&#39;s own virtual hard disk, so it won&#39;t overwrite any data you have on your console. For the external drive method your HDD isn&#39;t even touched at all.</p><p>TLDR: yes it is reversible, and no you won&#39;t loose any data.</p></details><details class="details custom-block"><summary>What are the PS4&#39;s specifications?</summary><ul><li>AMD APU <ul><li>8 cores, x86-64 CPU @1.6GHz (Fat and Slim) or @2.1GHz (Pro) based on the Jaguar architecture <ul><li>In theory, it&#39;s two Athlon 5150s duct taped together</li><li>Performance similar to an i3-2120 in multicore, or a Pentium 4 in single core</li></ul></li><li>AMD &quot;Liverpool&quot; (Fat/Slim) or &quot;Gladius&quot; (Pro) GPU <ul><li>Performance is comparable to an AMD HD 7850 or a Nvdia GTX 750 Ti on the Fat/Slim</li><li>For the Pro, we don&#39;t really know. Roughly a GTX 1060</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>8GB of GDDR5 memory <ul><li>Note the G, stands for Graphics. This isn&#39;t DDR5 as it wasn&#39;t invented in 2013. DDR3 was the only one available.</li><li>Additional 256MB DDR3 for &quot;Background applications&quot; on Fat/Slim, or 1GB DDR3 on Pro</li></ul></li></ul></details><details class="details custom-block"><summary>What do these specs mean in practice?</summary><p>Back in 2013 AMD was nearly about to collapse, because their processors were terrible. It was saved by the PS4&#39;s success.</p><p>This means that not only was the PS4 lacking a lot of CPU performance at launch, but it is also using GDDR5 memory, of which there&#39;s only 8GBs of. GDDR5 is not meant to do anything other than graphic workloads, so while it has a lot of bandwidth (it can move a lot of data at once) it has very high latency (getting to the location in memory takes a long time).</p></details><p>In practice, the PS4 is totally capable of handling not only modern web browsing, but light PC gaming as well (with limitations of course, especially on the GPU drivers side).</p><p>Another thing. We have two methods of installation:</p><ol><li>Internal HDD of the PS4</li><li>External Drive via USB</li></ol><p>But some consoles don&#39;t support internal drives. This will addressed further into the guide.</p>',10)])])}const y=t(l,[["render",n]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
