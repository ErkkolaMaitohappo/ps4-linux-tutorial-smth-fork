Buy an SSD and an adapter. To give you an explanation, it took me 30 minutes to update my CachyOS installation (1500MBs) and the system was extremely unresponsive.</p><p>Using an external SATA-USB adapter with a Samsung 870 EVO 500GB, the time it took shrinked to less than 5 minutes.</p><p>Therefore, let&#39;s clear some misinformation here:</p><ul><li>The PS4&#39;s internal HDD is a repurposed laptop 5400RPM drive. Preferably don&#39;t use this - even the PS4&#39;s own menus lag because of how slow it is.</li><li>The PS4 internal drive uses UFS encryption which slows down significantly.</li><li>You can clone your PS4 HDD into an SSD, if internal installation is a must for you</li><li>The PS4 doesn&#39;t support TRIM, so a possible internal SSD swap would be a lot slower in writing data (a cached SSD with a garbage collector would be a bit better though, so don&#39;t worry)</li><li>PS4 Fat and Slim are limited to SATA-II, which is 3Gbps in speed (roughly 375MB/s), which people online say it&#39;s not enough (it&#39;s enough for a PS4). On the other hand, the PS4 Pro runs at SATA-III, which is 6Gbps (up to 750MB/s), so that can saturate every SATA SSD on the market. <ul><li>External SSD, on my 500GB Samsung 870 EVO, is 350MB/s-ish. So you&#39;d get the same performance as an internal drive (theoretically)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Again, internal SSD swap hasn&#39;t been tested, so your mileage may vary if you wanna go that route.
